        <br>
        <br>Folkert de Jong is a Dutch sculptor and artist, born in Amsterdam (Egmond aan zee) and still lives/works there. As you can see his work consists of life size artworks and more. All of his works are heavily pointed towards the past and most of the times they all have an important hidden meaning behind them.
        <br>
        <br>De Jong was educated at the Amsterdam School of the Arts (1994-1996) and the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam (1998-2000).
        <br>
        <br>Folkert's work often alternates between colorful and cheerful and gruesome or dark, he himself likes the second one more. All his work can be found in this museum.
